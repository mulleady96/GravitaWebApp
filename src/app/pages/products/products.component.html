      <p>When you connect your app to Firebase, you’re not connecting through normal HTTP. You’re connecting through a WebSocket. WebSockets are much, much faster than HTTP.
        All of your data syncs automatically through that single WebSocket as fast as your client’s network can carry it.
        Firebase sends you new data as soon as it’s updated. When your client saves a change to the data, all connected clients receive the updated data almost instantly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authentication</li>
        <li>Hosting</li>
        <li>Realtime DB</li>
